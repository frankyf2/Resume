            <h2>Make an Application</h2>
            <p>I frequently submit an application after completing some of my lecturer's exercises. I also make some extra money by debugging other people's applications, so I've had some application debugging experience. Every week, my lecturer will provide a new exercise for me to complete in order to improve my skills. To create applications, I use programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. My team decided to create a car rental application for our final group project. As a result, I got an A in that class.</p>

            <h2>Editing Video</h2>
            <p>I began editing video when I was 15 years old. Over time, I began to film random events and then edit the footage together. Eventually became interested in video editing and pursued it as a hobby. When I was 17, I entered my first contest, which required me to make a random film. I edit video with a variety of softwares, including Sony Vegas Pro, Final Cut Pro, Davinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Filmora, but I prefer Premiere Pro because of its user interface. To summarise, video editing is enjoyable.</p>

            <h2> App/Website Design</h2>
            <p>To learn more about website development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I started looking at html at w3shools, Khan Academy, and various YouTuber. So, at the start of a new semester, I have the fundamentals of HTML. I occasionally go on the internet to look at other people's website coding in order to learn more about this. <br> I once took a job at my father's firm to develop their website, and I earned around RM1+++. I also assist a few of my friends with their coding so that I can learn from their errors. </p>

            <h2> Customer Service</h2>
			<p>Customer service is more than waiting on customers. It includes trying your best to make sure that the customer is satisfied. I know customer satisfaction is extremely important to your company, and it is always something I strive for in my retail experience. For example, when i just finished SPM i had a customer who was mad that we did not have an item in our store. I called my manager to find the item. I then had it picked up to our branch, and the customer had the item. Working hard to meet customersâ€™ needs is always my priority.</p>
